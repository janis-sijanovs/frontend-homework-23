# Frontend Homework 23

I have finished my twenty-third homework.

Vue annoys me.

Typescript doesn't help at all.
Error messages aren't helpful.

Once again, there are Typescript errors in the code
But at least it works.

I'm too tired to improve it and don't think I can manage on my own.
Will wait for the lesson to see how everyone else did.
